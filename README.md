# OCAW_STL
One Commit A Weak for studying lots of basic STL classes



Reference : https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL



My plan for implementing a standard library which can be used in cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux/Android/iOS) is to **copy** the EASTL, the reference. I will try to understand each line in EASTL.



My purpose for doing this is to improve my cross-platform programming ability and basic computer science  knowledge.
